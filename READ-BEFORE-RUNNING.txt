Good day to all please read before running the project.

1. Make sure to download the extensions from - vscjava.vscode-java-pack
    Can be copy pasted in the extensions tab in the search bar in the extensions tab in the visual studio code.

2. Always open the folder from the folder esports-database-jdbc. When in the folders tab sa right, it should show
    > .vscode
    > etc-guidelines-projectinfo
    > src
    >target
    > pom.xml

    as the subroot folders.

    Our main files should be in "src\main\java\ccinfom\group5\esports_app"

3. When running the file, always opt to run the file thru the Driver class (Above the main method, 
    there should be a 'Run | Debug' option, click on the Run option to run the file).
    Para hindi makalat yung classes sa mga folders.

    DON'T USE THE ONE ON THE TOP RIGHT

4. Make sure the port of your MySQL is 3306.
    If not set to 3306, go to "C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0" and find the my.ini file.
    Copy file outside the folder,
    edit the two port lines to 3306,
    copy back to MySQL Server 8.0 folder.

    There are two lines there that have the port number, change it to 3306.

5. Change your password in MySQL. Copy paste the code from below in a query.
    
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;  

    IF ABOVE CODE DIDN'T WORK, TRY THIS ONE
    
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;  

    If you have a different username (apart from 'root'), change it first before applying the code at the top. 
    Copy the below code and paste it in a query.

    UPDATE mysql.user SET user='root' WHERE User = 'current_user_name';

    Restart MySQL to verify the changes.
